## Executive Summary
This global warming and climate change crisis is very much an imminent threat to every living being on earth. By taking on this topic as my final project, I wanted to help the intended audience make data-driven decisions with these three research questions that I addressed through my visualizations. They are:

1.	How has the increase of CO2 emissions affected the temperature in the countries around the world?
2.	How has global warming and climate change affected the glaciers and the ocean levels?
3.	What impact has global warming and climate change had on the economy, renewable energy, and public belief?

Before we dive into my visualizations, I think it is best if we define what global warming and climate change are. You might already know or have an idea as to what they mean, but just in case, according to NASA, global warming is "the long-term heating of Earth’s climate system observed since the pre-industrial period (between 1850 and 1900) due to human activities, primarily fossil fuel burning, which increases heat-trapping greenhouse gas levels in Earth’s atmosphere" (NASA, p. 2). So how does this definition compare to climate change? Climate change, according to NASA, refers to "a long-term change in the average weather patterns that have come to define Earth’s local, regional, and global climates" (NASA, p. 3). Global warming and climate change can be used interchangeably, just that climate change also used to describe both human and natural warming effects.

## Recommendation
Now that we understand or know how imminent the dangers of the climate crisis are, what can we do about it? The first thing we can do is to reduce our use of fossil fuels, thereby decarbonizing, to quickly reduce our CO2 and methane emissions. We can do this by increasing the switch to wind and solar energy alternatives now that these alternatives are becoming more economically viable. We can also plant more trees to restore forests and grasslands. Additionally, there is a machine called the carbon capture and storage, and this device captures the CO2 in the air already. However, it runs on fossil fuels, and we do not know enough of the effectiveness of this machine. Another alternative would be doing ocean fertilization, which creates plankton blooms to absorb CO2 in the air at oceans, but the long-term impacts have not been studied enough to know if this is a safe method. A second major thing we can do is to get every, or as many more countries possible, working together to set climate goals and reduce greenhouse emissions. And a third major thing to do is increasing political support to encourage individuals to adopt low carbon-intensive lifestyles, like going vegetarian, food-waste reduction, and renewable energy options.

## Next Steps
For this project in the future, the logical next steps would be to find up-to-date data. As we saw with some of the visualizations, they are not up to the current year of 2022, preventing us from seeing the much-needed changes in data. This data research would also include finding out if all disasters were recorded for the global economic loss of each year, as well as more research needed in the correlation between increased economic loss and weather catastrophes, as discussed in analysis five. A final future step would be to include the global warming and climate change policies and their impact on the climate crisis.

## In Conclusion
So, what are your plans now after learning from my created climate visualizations on the impact global warming and climate change has had on the environment, economy, and us all, in one form or another? Will you be going vegetarian or vegan, how about reducing the amount of food waste, or even switching to solar panels or driving an electric car? I would like to close this by reminding all that there is no Planet B, so it is important that we take immediate action to solve this problem together, whether it be reducing our carbon footprint, or building the next invention to solve this.
